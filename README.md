[Quanlse (量脉)](https://quanlse.baidu.com) is a cloud-based platform for quantum control developed by the [Institute for Quantum Computing](https://quantum.baidu.com) at Baidu Research. Quanlse aims to bridge the gap between quantum software and hardware. It provides efficient and professional quantum control solutions via an open-source SDK strengthened by Quanlse Cloud Service.

Quanlse supports the pulse generation and scheduling of arbitrary single-qubit and two-qubit gates. With the help of toolkits in Quanlse, one can also use Quanlse for modeling physical devices, simulating dynamical evolution, and visualizing error analysis. More interestingly, users can achieve pulse-level control of quantum algorithms using Quanlse. Furthermore, Quanlse also supports advanced research and development (R&D) in the field of quantum control.

## Install

We strongly recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for your R&D environment for the best experience.

### Install via pip

We recommend the following way of installing Quanlse with `pip`,

```bash
pip install Quanlse
```

### Download and install via Github

You can also download all the files and install Quanlse locally,

```bash
git clone http://github.com/baidu/Quanlse
cd Quanlse
pip install -e .
```

### Run programs

Now, you can try to run a program to verify whether Quanlse has been installed successfully.

```bash
cd Example
python 1-Example-Pi-Pulse.py
```

## Introduction and developments

### Overview

To get started with Quanlse, users are recommended to go through the [Overview](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/overview) firstly to acquire the whole picture of this platform. [Quick Start](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/quickstart) could then be a good place to guide you on how to use Quanlse Cloud Service step by step and how to construct your first program using Quanlse. Next, users are encouraged to learn more functions and applications from the [tutorials](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/tutorial-overview) Quanlse provided. Finally, it would be great if users could solve their own problems using Quanlse. For complete and detailed documentation of the Quanlse API, please refer to our [API documentation](https://quanlse.baidu.com/api/).

### Tutorials

Quanlse provides detailed and comprehensive tutorials from fundamental to advanced topics. Each tutorial currently supports reading on our [website](https://quanlse.baidu.com/#/doc/tutorial-overview).
