    "\n",
    "  In quantum computing, we call an action upon qubit(s) a **quantum gate**. In superconducting quantum circuits, a quantum gate is implemented by applying external microwave pulses and magnetic flux. A single-qubit gate, the focus of this section, can be written as the symbol $U$, which is a $2\\times2$ unitary matrix in linear algebra. As shown in the graph below, a single-qubit gate can also be visualized by a vector ($|\\psi\\rangle$) transformation on what we call a Bloch Sphere. In particular, $|\\psi\\rangle=\\cos(\\theta/2)|0\\rangle+e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta/2)|1\\rangle$ represents the superposition of two quantum states, $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$. Via a single-qubit gate, we can transform a quantum state on the Bloch Sphere \\[1\\]. \n"

Ideally, the non-equidistant energy levels in a transmon allow qubit states to be individually addressed through a frequency-selective driving field. However, the fact that the transmon qubit is weakly anharmonic suggests that the finite bandwidth of the driving field can lead to transitions out of the computational states. This effect is known as **leakage**. In our model, leakage into state $|2\\rangle$ - the first level above the computational space - is taken into account by treating the superconducting qubit as a simplified three-level system.
