    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**QuanlseScheduler** is a module that allows for automatic generation of fidelity-optimized and scheduled pulse sequence for a given quantum circuit set to perform a certain quantum computing task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QuanlseScheduler** has the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Highly automatic: it generates high-fidelity pulses automatically and simultaneously minimizes the overall gate operation time.\n",
    "- Practical: it considers several limitations of the superconducting quantum system, including leakage errors, decoherence, etc.\n",
    "- Flexible: it gives users the freedom to customize qubits and circuit parameters. This can also be easily extended to other quantum computing platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QuanlseScheduler** achieves the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It generates parameters and AWG input signal arrays for fidelity-optimized pulses when leakage into the state $|2\\rangle$ is taken into account.\n",
    "- It is also capable of scheduling pulses to minimize idle time and therefore reduce decoherence losses.\n",
    "- At the same time, it allows for the visualization of pulse sequences for the users to check the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNOT gate is rarely directly implemented on superconducting quantum chips. Instead, it is often constructed by piecing together single-qubit gates and other two-qubit gates like CR gate or ISWAP gate that can be easily implemented on a superconducting chip (often called native gates). The two-qubit gates that are available in the transmon-like superconducting qubit architecture can be divided into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flux-controlled**\n",
    "\n",
    "This class of gates offers the advantage of short gate time to minimize decoherence error. However, tuning the qubit frequency can introduce flux noises and lead to the problem of frequency crowding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All-microwave control**\n",
    "\n",
    "CR gate allows for an all-microwave control, which alleviates the problem of flux noise. However, the much longer time-scale limits the gate fidelity (because of the decoherence effects of qubits).\n",
    "\n",
    "![cnot](figures/cnot-gate.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since CZ gates can be used to construct a CNOT gate easily by using only two other single-qubit gates, QuanlseScheduler offers this way to construct a CNOT gate in a quantum circuit."

    "## Rules in scheduling the gates\n",
    "\n",
    "All gates, both single and two-qubit gates, can be scheduled by **QuanlseScheduler**, and they must obey the following rules to maximize the overall fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A two-qubit gate can only start when both qubits have completed gates scheduled before it.\n",
    "- Because of the decoherent properties of the qubits, the total gate operation time must be as short as possible to reduce idle time and therefore minimize gate errors."

    "In 2000, DÃ¼r et al. found that a tripartite system can be entangled in a different way from GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) state, which they called $W$-state \\[4\\]:\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike the GHZ state, the remaining $(N-1)$-qubit state is still entangled if one of the qubit is traced out for a prepared $N$-qubit $W$-state. A three-partite $W$-state is a superposition state of three eigenstates, and only one of the particles is excited in each eigenstate. Due to its high robustness against loss, $W$-state received considerable attention in the field of quantum communication.\n",
