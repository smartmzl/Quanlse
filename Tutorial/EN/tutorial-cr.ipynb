    "\n",
    "Unlike some of the other gates we have seen before, the Cross-Resonance (CR) gate only uses microwaves to implement the two-qubit interaction such that we could avoid noise due to magnetic flux. The physical realization of the CR gate includes two coupled qubits with fixed frequencies. This can be done by driving the control qubit at the frequency of the target qubit. This is shown in the figure below:\n",

In the doubly rotating frame, the effective Hamiltonian for cross-resonance effect in terms of the drive strength $A$, detuning $\\Delta$, drive phase $\\phi_0$, and coupling strength $g_{01}$ is given \\[1\\] (for simplicity, we choose $\\hbar = 1$) :\n",
