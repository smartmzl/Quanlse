    "The iSWAP gate is a native gate in superconducting quantum computing platforms, because it can be realized directly using coupling between two superconducting qubits (XY interaction). In superconducting circuits, the iSWAP gate is implemented by tuning the qubits into resonance in a duration of time. By performing a rotating wave approximation, the two-qubit coupling Hamiltonian can be written as \\[2\\]:\n",
